<h3 class="archive__subtitle">Hi there!</h3>

<p>I'm a French engineering student at Ensimag, and I've been fascinated by computer graphics since high school. One thing I love the most is making cool graphics and 3D stuff.</p>

<!--<p>Besides C and C++, I've also learned Java and Kotlin for making apps on Android phones. It's been super fun seeing what I can create for mobile devices.</p>-->

<p>These days, whenever I'm free, I'm diving deep into the world of 3D rendering - basically how to make things look super realistic on computers. This knowledge is fueling some cool computer graphics projects I'm working on!</p>
