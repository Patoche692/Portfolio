<h2>Hi there! &#128075;</h2>

<p>
  I'm an engineering student at Grenoble INP - Ensimag, aiming to pursue research in computer graphics.
</p>
<p>
  My interests include path sampling techniques like ReSTIR,
  acceleration structures for ray tracing, material modeling,
  and other topics related to realistic and efficient light
  transport simulation for both real-time and offline applications.
